## Responsive Layout - Bootstrap Edition 

The purpose of this project is to draw comparison across different css frameworks that are available as of September 2018. 
The first front-end framework I intend to test is Bootstrap, developed by Mark Otto, a Twitter developer. It is quite popular at hackathons due to it's ease of use. 

The attributes of a front-end development I am asessing include:

1. Skill Level 
* How easy is the css framework to pick up from a beginners perspective, does it have an intuitive pattern that makes natural sense to the user? 

2. Responsive Design 
* Is the layout consistently responsive across browsers and devices without having to excessively code around these conditions?

3. CSS Pre-processors 
 * Does the framework allow the use of pre-processors such as SASS/LESS?
 
4. Appearance 
 * Does the framework turn a look? Although many frameworks are made for rapid wireframing, many others are made to be the base for further design customisations. This effects the end product, frameworks that make it difficult to reverse engineer their css to implement these tweaks may end up looking generic.
